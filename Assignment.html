        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Beat the eggs</b>: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are <br> well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
            <li><b>Heat the pan</b>: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. </li>
            <li><b>Cook the omelette</b>: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the <br> pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
            <li><b>Add fillings (optional)</b>: When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly<br> runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li><b>Fold and serve</b>: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it <br>over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
            <li><b>Enjoy</b>: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
